This wine is complex, deep and potently rich in texture with layers of black cherry and red fruit surrounded by elegant toasted oak. Pair it with a braised rack of lamb or filet mignon.

A bet that paid off thankfully, with this enticing Chardonnay. No oak in sight but three months ageing on the lees makes for a richer texture and mouth-feel.

Well, it has a disarmingly beautiful, almost haunting bouquet with pure black fruit laced with cedar, orange blossom and violet aromas that blossom in the glass. I cannot recollect a Rauzan-Segla as delineated as this. The palate is medium-bodied but with ripe, quite bold tannin that lends this wine much more volume than in previous vintages. This just fills the mouth and satiates the senses. There is a fine line of acidity here and tints of black truffle. There is a wondrous mineral tension on the finish and yet this is a Margaux that is determined and succeeds in satiating all the senses...apart from sound. So put your favorite musician on and savour this exceptional wine over the coming years. A benchmark. Drink: 2021 - 2060.”

The bouquet is gorgeous and delineated with wild berry, tangy spice, crushed mineral and forest flower. Yet, the wine's color is dark, brooding and austere. The wine offers exuberance and energy in the mouth, thanks to its balanced acidity and seemingly never-ending finish. It should age forward for twenty years or more.

,,France Wine,1037,0,,,350,,,,Bordeaux Blend,"“Following a very long harvest stretching nearly two months, the 2015 Château d’Yquem came in at 13.9% alcohol and 144 grams per liter of residual sugar, sporting a pH of 3.65 and six grams per liter of tartaric acid. None of these numbers, however, even remotely begin to tell you how profound this wine is. The nose opens with electric notes of ripe pineapples, green mango, orange blossoms and lemon tart with hints of fungi, lime zest, crushed rocks and jasmine. The freshness on the palate is just astonishing, permeating and lifting layer upon layer of tropical fruits and earthy notions, all encased in a sumptuous texture and culminating in a very, very long, mineral-tinged finish. Truly, this is a legendary vintage for d’Yquem. I’ve been conservative with my drinking window here, and I would not be at all surprised if our descendants are drinking this vintage well into the next century. Drink: 2025 - 2065.”

The fermentation occurred in stainless steel vats where a selected yeast strain was introduced to further enhance the varietal fruit flavours and aromas. Early bottling ensured the natural freshness of this was captured ready to be enjoyed.

It would benefit from decanting in advance, and notes of beef blood emerge with time in the glass. The palate is medium to full-bodied with juicy tannins and a supple texture that fills your mouth, ending with a pleasant bitter note.
