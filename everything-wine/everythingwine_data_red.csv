Violets, black cherries and figs dance above a uniquely intense body and frame, power and heft to match the nose, and finishes spicy and stony.

The Costanti family dates back to the 15th century, and their contributions towards establishing the 1555 Republic of Siena gave them huge endowments of land around Montalcino, where the vineyards still lie today (amongst Etruscan archeological remains). Having traded politics for farming in the 1700s, the Costantis, along with Biondi Santi, shaped the emerging “Brunello” wines from oxidative house plonk towards cellar-worthy fine wines. As Costanti is widely considered to be second only to Biondi Santi in championing traditional Brunello, this 2012 needs a couple of years to learn who not to bite, but the ingredients for dynamite are all here. Cherries, cinnamon hearts and black Twizzlers beaten by stones and giant oranges"".

Freemark Abbey  Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon 750 mL,"Let us raise a glass to Classic Napa, in both style and budget. Part of the Napa equivalent to the Original Six, Freemark was on Team USA at the Judgement in Paris 1976, but unlike its teammates (Stag’s Leap, Ridge) it hasn’t jacked up its price or ripeness much in the subsequent years. Harkening back to a time when Napa considered the Médoc as its guiding star, Freemark Abbey (founded in 1939) is full bodied but low-glycerine, favouring subtle structure and balanced fruit over whiz-bang-dynamite-anvils. Because of its non-flamboyancy, Freemark often occupies the “Friend Zone”, while wine drinkers fall for flashy fruit bombs with shiny sports cars, Freemark is just dependably there. Seriously, be honest: when’s the last time you tried Freemark Abbey? If there was ever a time to fall back in love with this wine, it’s with this offering – bucking the trend of the valley this is stronger here than the three previous ones, the texture is glorious and the dark fruits dance with spicy sticks of cedar and licorice.

One of Napa’s Crown Princes, from the middle of the region’s golden streak of vintages, ironically elevated by the long drought.

The ’13 has a more friendly fruit weight but the ’14 is structured, dense and timeless, perhaps due to the rare omission of Merlot in that year’s blend. As close as Insignia has come to the “classic Napa” style in some time, with chocolate and coffee notes bracing the “Night Of A Thousand Berries” nose that is so characteristically Phelps. 2014 is Motorhead compared with 2013’s Elton John, focused and hardcore, not really caring what you think of it… yet.

Penfolds 11/12 RWT  Shiraz 750 mL,"""What if we made Grange with French oak instead of American oak”, was the question. “Let’s test it out” said John Duval, the Chief Winemaker at Penfolds in 1995. Thus was born “Red Wine Trial”, which Penfolds decided was far too romantic and shortened to RWT when the first vintage was released in 2000. RWT is like Christian Slater in Heathers, not easy to make friends with initially but things get real interesting if you actually do. Bordeaux is clearly the guiding light here, structure currently holds sway over fruit (and may always), but the muscle and timeless frame are bulletproof and the spicy vanilla, cherry notes over earthen game almost trick you into thinking this is going to be subtle. It ain’t. Of all 3 vintages the 2011 is the most Bordelais, elegant and drinkable, the 2013 carries the most bullets. - Jordan Carrier, Vintage Room Consultant.",564278,https://www.everythingwine.ca/penfolds-11-12-rwt-shiraz-750-ml,Australia,Barossa,Red,Shiraz,,"Ascending florals, primarily violet (laced with pepper) harmoniously project alongside wafts of white chocolate/cocoa powder.

No overt barrel-ferment characters apparent.  Perhaps swamped by depth of fruit (black cherry), mocha, chestnut, aniseed and other derivatives? A spoil of charcuterie delights, primarily cold meats (‘raw’/carpaccio), shadow the more reticent panforte and cola notes that ever so slowly appear with aeration.

""To hear Dave Powell explain how he was kicked out of Torbreck, the winery he founded, is to experience a masterclass in Australian profanity, after our meeting I had to check our building’s foundations for fissures. At Torbreck, Dave made Australia’s first 100pt Parker wine, but since he owned no land, he built handshake relationships with all of Barossa’s Old Vine growers to build his reputation. I’m not sure what Torbreck makes wine from now, because all of those growers (and their fruit) followed Dave to his new winery he founded with his son Callum (who works half the year in Hermitage with J.L. Chave).

Yarra Yering Dry Red #2 Red Blend 750 mL,"""2018’s Australian Winemaker of the Year Sarah Crowe returns with another whizz-bang Shiraz from the cool(er) climate of Yarra Valley, near Melbourne. Hard to describe Yarra wines except by discounting what they aren’t: they don’t have the confected fruit compote of McLaren Vale, they don’t have the black pepper of Barossa, nor are they as light footed as Norther Rhône Syrahs or rigidly structured like Margaret River wines. What they do have is a friendly, comfort-food exterior that can somewhat belie enormous reservoirs of thermo-nuclear inner strength.  Often called an “iron fist in a velvet glove”, Dry Red No 2 is teeming with white pepper, red Nibs and baking chocolate, the body is plenty full but can still do pull-ups, the finish – and it’s famous for this – peers into the portal to forever. Outstanding vintage for a wine notorious for its vintage variation."" - Jordan Carrier, Everything Wine Vintage Room Consultant.",214505,https://www.everythingwine.ca/yarra-yering-dry-red-red-blend-750-ml,Australia,Yarra Valley,Red,Red Blend,,"Dry Red Wine No. 2 reveals a medium-deep garnet-purple color and fragrant notes of mulberries, spiced blackberries and black cherries with nuances of violets, peach blossoms and incense.
